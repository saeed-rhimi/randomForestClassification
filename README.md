# Random Forest Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a Random Forest Classification model in Python, aimed at demonstrating the application of machine learning techniques using the Random Forest algorithm. The model is designed to predict outcomes based on given inputs, utilizing a dataset of social network advertisements.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Social_Network_Ads.csv`. It contains information related to social network advertisements and is instrumental in training and testing the Random Forest Classification model.

## Libraries and Dependencies
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Installation and Setup
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## File Descriptions
- `main.ipynb`: Contains the implementation of the Random Forest Classification model.
- `Social_Network_Ads.csv`: The dataset file used for training and testing the model.

## Running the Code
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Open the `main.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Ensure that `Social_Network_Ads.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to see the model in action.

## Model Description
The model uses the Random Forest algorithm, a popular ensemble learning method used for classification tasks. The specifics of the model, including parameters and methods, are detailed within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Results and Visualization
The notebook includes a section on results analysis and visualization, showcasing the effectiveness of the model in classification tasks.
